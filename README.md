###Hit test
* Hittable areas (environment that should be walkable etc.) all need to be placed on the 'Obstacle' layer. The Player will make hittest on all objects placed on this 'Obstacle'-layer.
* Different players platforms will be placed on their own layor probably to restrain the other players from walking on other player's platforms.
